        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert made of layers of espresso-soaked ladyfingers, mascarpone cream, and cocoa powder. The ladyfingers are dipped in coffee, absorbing the bold flavors, while the mascarpone mixture adds a rich, creamy texture. Once layered, the dessert is chilled to meld the flavors, creating a balanced treat of sweetness and bitterness.</p>
        <p>Widely popular worldwide, tiramisu is perfect for any occasion, often served in individual portions or as a trifle. Variations can include flavored liqueurs like rum or Marsala, or even fruit and chocolate for added complexity. Its indulgent yet not overly heavy qualities make it a go-to dessert for celebrations.</p>
